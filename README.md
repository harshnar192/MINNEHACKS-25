# Side-Quest IRL : Prototype

# Inspiration
Sometimes people feel spontaneous and want to go to some type of event without having any actual plans. Alternatively, maybe people want to host an event but don't have the means to advertise it and get people to go. We thought, how can we foster a stronger local community, and while doing that, let people have fun and gain rewards for going to events and maybe going out of their comfort zone?

# What it does
Side-Quest IRL allows users to create and choose to attend events. When creating an event, you choose a spot on the map, and it will mark a waypoint, asking you to insert the name of the event, the starting time of the event, and the ending time of the event. This waypoint then goes to the other page that allows people to choose what event they want to. When a user decides to attend an event, they will earn XP to level up, which would lead to things such as titles and other rewards.

# How We Built It
We decided to use a MERN stack for this project. Additionally, we had to get ahold of an API of a map; we used "Open Layer.". Most of the code was coded in JS, with the occasional CSS and HTML (using React) for the front end page. For the backend, we had to use MongoDB to store where the events are and all its other variables. MongoDB was our choice of data-storing program because we plan on implementing tags for each event that the user can filter by, so NoSQL works better for this.

# Challenges we ran into
- Firstly, this was the first time any of us worked with the MERN stack, so a lot of time was spent googling and watching videos.
- We could not load our logo into the home page.
- The map took a very long time for us to implement because it was our first time working with a map API.

# What we learned
We learned first and foremost that we still have a ways to go when it comes to learning to code the entire stack. Additionally, we were using programs that we had little to no experience with (basically everything besides the front end HTML/CSS/JS), so it's good to know the places we need to touch on. We learned a bit of the process of building a project from scratch, as some members have never done so before. Overall, we are proud of what we were able to accomplish with the knowledge we had and happy that we know what our next steps have to be to become computer scientists.
